# ESP32 Microcontroller Setup Guide

## Requirements
- ESP32 microcontroller
- Arduino IDE
- USB cable for programming
- Required libraries: sensor_library.h, communication_library.h

## Steps
1. **Install Arduino IDE**: Download and install the Arduino IDE from the official website.
2. **Set Up ESP32 Board**:
   - Open Arduino IDE.
   - Go to `File` -> `Preferences`.
   - In the `Additional Board Manager URLs` field, add the following URL: `https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json`.
   - Go to `Tools` -> `Board` -> `Board Manager`.
   - Search for `esp32` and install the `esp32` by Espressif Systems.
3. **Select ESP32 Board**:
   - Go to `Tools` -> `Board` and select your ESP32 board (e.g., `ESP32 Dev Module`).
4. **Connect ESP32 to Computer**: Use a USB cable to connect the ESP32 to your computer.
5. **Install Required Libraries**:
   - Go to `Sketch` -> `Include Library` -> `Manage Libraries`.
   - Install any additional libraries required by your code (e.g., WiFi, sensor libraries).
6. **Upload Code**:
   - Open the `main.ino` file in Arduino IDE.
   - Click on the upload button to upload the code to the ESP32.
7. **Monitor Serial Output**:
   - Open the Serial Monitor (`Tools` -> `Serial Monitor`) to view the output from the ESP32.

Your ESP32 should now be set up and running the code for the mini power generator project.
